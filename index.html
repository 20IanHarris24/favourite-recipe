      <h1>A Hearty Chilli con Carne</h1>
      
      <header>
       <p>
        This recipe is my family's go-to comfort food on wet and windy Autumn days. It's easy to make and packs loads of flavour inspite it using mostly store cupboard ingredients.

          <h4>Serving suggestions</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>Lime wedges, rice, guacamole, soured cream and green salad</li>
            </ul>
        
        <h2> Method</h2>
        
        <ol>
          <p>
            <li>Heat the oil in a large, heavy-based saucepan with a lid and fry the onion and garlic until softened. Increase the heat and add the mince, cooking quickly until browned and breaking down any chunks of meat with a wooden spoon. Pour in the red wine, if using, and boil for 2–3 minutes.</li>
          </p>
          
          <p>
            <li>Stir in the tomatoes, tomato purée, fresh chilli or chilli flakes, cumin, ground coriander, cinnamon and Worcestershire sauce and crumble in the stock cube. Season well with salt and pepper.</li>
          </p>

          <p>
            <li>Bring to a simmer, cover with a lid and cook over a gentle heat for about 50 minutes to 1 hour, stirring occasionally until the mixture is rich and thickened.</li>
          </p>

          <p>
            <li>Add the kidney beans and fresh coriander. Cook for a further 10 minutes, uncovered, before removing from the heat and add any extra seasoning if necessary.</li>

          </p>

          <li>Serve along with the serving suggestions or sides of your choice</li>
        </ol>
      
        <h3>Good to know(s)</h3>

        <p>
            The chilli is much tastier a day or two after it's cooked because the flavours develop and the texture becomes richer. Simply leave to cool, stick in the fridge and gently heat before serving.
        </p>
        <p> 
          If you're eating the chilli on the day you prepared it, any leftovers can be frozen in individual portions in well-sealed sandwich bags or boxes. Reheat from frozen in a saucepan of water for about 15–20 minutes until steaming hot.
        </p>

        <h4>Extra flavour?</h4>

        <p>
          If you want to increase the flavour of the dish, spices such as ground cumin, coriander and cinnamon round out the flavours without adding much heat (that’s where the chillies come in). If you enjoy smoky flavours, try adding smoked paprika in addition to the other spices.
        </p>
        <p>
          In this recipe, red wine, Worcestershire sauce and beef stock add depth of flavour and some sweetness, but you can also add a square or two of dark chocolate at the end. Also, browning the meat thoroughly will add lots of flavour
