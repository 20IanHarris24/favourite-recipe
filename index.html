              This recipe is my family's go-to comfort food on wet and windy Autumn days. It's easy to make and packs loads of flavour inspite it using mostly store cupboard ingredients.

            The chilli is much tastier a day or two after it's cooked because the flavours develop and the texture becomes richer. Simply leave to cool, stick in the fridge and gently heat before serving.
          </p>
          <p class = "list"> 
            If you're eating the chilli on the day you prepared it, any leftovers can be frozen in individual portions in well-sealed sandwich bags or boxes. Reheat from frozen in a saucepan of water for about 15–20 minutes until steaming hot.
          </p>
          
          
          <h4 class="extra">Extra flavour?</h4>
          
          <p class = "list">
            If you want to increase the flavour of the dish, spices such as ground cumin, coriander and cinnamon round out the flavours without adding much heat (that’s where the chillies come in). If you enjoy smoky flavours, try adding smoked paprika in addition to the other spices.
          </p>
          <p class = "list">
            In this recipe, red wine, Worcestershire sauce and beef stock add depth of flavour and some sweetness, but you can also add a square or two of dark chocolate at the end. Also, browning the meat thoroughly will add lots of flavour
